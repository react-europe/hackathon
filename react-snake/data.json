We were inspired by all the things that we learned and the new perspectives we gained. But we also knew that we wouldn't have the same environment at home, and we thought \"Ugh, back to learning in isolation!\" Coworking spaces and user groups don't really make the difference for us. So in talking about this, we found that we felt the same way, and came up with the idea of meeting up for continuous learning in a friendly group. Here's the idea: - Meet every 2 weeks for 1 whole day. - We meet in a place where we can sit together. - We start with a coworking space. In the morning, we talk briefly about what we want to learn, so that small groups can form. - We spend the day with self directed learning. We help each other in case we get stuck. - Over coffee breaks and lunch there is opportunity to chat. - In the evening we reserve 20 minutes for presentations, aka lightning talks. Anybody can talk about what the person thinks might be interesting to the others (this is different from Hackership). The aim is to create a friendly group with diverse skills and skill levels.","who":"Co-Learners"},{"org_starttime":"2015-06-13 13:09:32 EDT","country":"us","city":"Denver","timezone":"US\/Mountain","coordinator_member":{"name":"Reed Anderson","username":"user 83063322"},"fee_currency":"USD","fee":0,"rating":0,"lon":-105.01,"number":872,"content_private":0,"fee_label":"","ctime":"2015-06-13 13:09:32 EDT","topic_id":7029,"state":"CO","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/global_438584737.jpeg","member_count":26,"lat":39.77,"chapter_link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Web-Components-Boulder-Denver\/","zip":"80211","photo_urls":{"six00":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/600_438584737.jpeg","thumb":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/thumb_438584737.jpeg","event_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/event_438584737.jpeg","global":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/global_438584737.jpeg","clean":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/clean_438584737.jpeg","clean_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/clean_438584737.jpeg","highres":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/highres_438584737.jpeg","six00_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/600_438584737.jpeg","600":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/600_438584737.jpeg","600_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/600_438584737.jpeg","highres_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/highres_438584737.jpeg","thumb_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/thumb_438584737.jpeg","global_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/global_438584737.jpeg","event":"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/a\/e\/c\/1\/event_438584737.jpeg"},"rating_count":0,"event_photo_id":438584737,"name":"Web Components Boulder\/Denver","coordinator_member_id":83063322,"topic":{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","topic_id":7029},"fee_desc":"","chapter_id":18670281,"short_desc":"<p>Learn, fix it, build.

The format is simple: we pick some sort of venue (coffee shop, office area, lounge, or even a wine bar), make the announcement, and hope that members come. If you're familiar with the LinkedIn Hack Night (graciously hosted by BayNode's Adam Crabtree), members show up, find an allocated table, sit with unfamiliar or familiar faces, and do whatever they feel like in the JS-inspired environment. This is a great opportunity to participate in a mini-lab of sorts within casual environments, where it is most likely that you will learn something new w\/ JS (framework, library, debugging strategies, etc.), meet cool people, get some stuff done, showcase your project, and the like.<\/p>","who":"Hackers"},{"org_starttime":"2014-01-05 19:37:24 EST","country":"au","city":"Adelaide","timezone":"Australia\/Adelaide","coordinator_member":{"name":"Rahul Trikha","username":"rahult"},"fee_currency":"AUD","fee":0,"rating":4.93,"lon":138.6,"number":441,"content_private":0,"fee_label":"","ctime":"2014-01-05 19:37:24 EST","topic_id":7029,"state":"","member_count":92,"lat":-34.93,"chapter_link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/adelaidejs\/","zip":"meetup5","photo_urls":{"six00_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull","600_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull","highres_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull","event_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull","thumb_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull","global_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull","clean_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.comnull"},"rating_count":12,"event_photo_id":0,"name":"Adelaide front-end JS frameworks","coordinator_member_id":14426906,"topic":{"urlkey":"javascript","name":"JavaScript","topic_id":7029},"fee_desc":"","chapter_id":11825202,"short_desc":"<p>This meet-up is focused on learning and applying front-end JS frameworks like Ember.js, AngularJS and React etc to create and maintain ambitious web applications.<\/p>","who":"javascripters"},{"org_starttime":"2013-12-16 00:32:23 EST","country":"il","city":"Tel Aviv-Yafo","timezone":"Asia\/Jerusalem","coordinator_member":{"name":"Aviran Mordo","username":"user 14426994"},"fee_currency":"USD","fee":0,"rating":4.5,"lon":34.77,"number":1012,"content_private":0,"fee_label":"","ctime":"2013-12-16 00:32:23 EST","topic_id":3833,"state":"","photo_url":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/global_435611133.jpeg","member_count":2237,"lat":32.07,"chapter_link":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/at-wix\/","zip":"meetup2","photo_urls":{"six00":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/600_435611133.jpeg","thumb":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/thumb_435611133.jpeg","event_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/event_435611133.jpeg","global":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/global_435611133.jpeg","clean":"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/clean_435611133.jpeg","clean_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/clean_435611133.jpeg","highres":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/highres_435611133.jpeg","six00_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/600_435611133.jpeg","600":"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/600_435611133.jpeg","600_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/600_435611133.jpeg","highres_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/highres_435611133.jpeg","thumb_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/thumb_435611133.jpeg","global_secure":"https:\/\/a248.e.akamai.net\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/global_435611133.jpeg","event":"http:\/\/photos4.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/2\/b\/7\/d\/event_435611133.jpeg"},"rating_count":32,"event_photo_id":435611133,"name":"Meetups at Wix","coordinator_member_id":14426994,"topic":{"urlkey":"softwaredev","name":"Software Development","topic_id":3833},"fee_desc":"","chapter_id":11468592,"short_desc":"<p>At <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wix.com\">Wix<\/a> we have internal tech talks almost every week.
