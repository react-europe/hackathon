# react-movies

To build and run the project:

```sh
npm install
npm start # Starts the development server on port 3000
cd cordova
cordova platforms add ios
cordova run ios
# Then go to localhost:3000/cordova/www
```

Run `npm run build` instead of `npm start` to build a production version of the app to run on a physical device.
