## ReactWars


... is a mobile social game based on the meetup api & network. You as someone who's coming to a React Converence is probably part of a local meetup with React or Javascript as a topic. Your local meetup is your Guild. If you interesect with anybody from another guild you can choose to fight them, but choose wisely. If you meet somebody from your same guild you can train together or you can request a health boost.

## Running

- The mobile app is built with React Native so, open xcode project and run
- The api is Ruby on Rails. It's included in the repo, but it's also running on heroku (and the mobile app is configured to point at it so no setup required there)
